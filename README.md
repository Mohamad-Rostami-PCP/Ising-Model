# 2D Ising Model (Monte Carlo)

Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising lattice.

---

## 📂 Code Structure
- **main.py** → spin lattice + MC algorithm

---

## 🔑 Important Variables
- `L`: lattice size
- `T`: temperature
- `steps`: Monte Carlo steps

---

## ⚙️ How to Interact
Change `T` and `L` in `main.py` to see ordering/disordering.

---

## 🧠 Physical Intuition
- Low T → ordered spins
- High T → disordered spins
- Critical T → clusters emerge

---

## 🧮 Numerical Models
- **Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm**
- Uses random sampling and Boltzmann probability to accept/reject spin flips
